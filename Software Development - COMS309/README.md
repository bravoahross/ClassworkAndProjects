# Android App Development

### Description

In COMS 309, our group was tasked with creating an app with many features and 3 user types. We executed bi-weekly sprints and were expected to push code twice a week to a shared GitLab. Together, we made an app that allows gas stations to be rated and found on maps based on their price, location, and quality. 

I was on the front end team, so I was in charge of the android screens and overall logic. We implemented our project with a backend built with a SQL database two other members in my group created. We implemented REST APIs, JSON requests (POST, GET, PUT), Websockets for live updates, and many other features. The app screens can be found in the frontend folder under main, the relationships between the tables and the frontend can be found in the Block Diagrams and Tables.pdf, and the initial design and logic flowcharts can be found in the Screen Sketches.pdf. 

Skills used:Java, APIs, Testing, and Source Control (GitLab specifically) were the focuses of this project. We also learned about agile environments.
